Project 1:
Basic alignment of reads against a 10kilobase genome
Find snps(disparities) between reference genome and genome reads came from
*deal with 10% read error

Project 2:
Alignment with 1-million length genome.
Infer a donor genome given reads and a reference genome.
10% read errors due to "genetic contamination"
Maps snps, insertions, and deletions from donor to reference genome

Project 3:
Assembling genome contigs given reads from a donor sequence + 10% contamination from a genetic source
Reconstruct contigs--the longest sequences of the donor ensured correct.
